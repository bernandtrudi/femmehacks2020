    <h3>
      How Does Interest Work?
    </h3>
      <p>
        Interest can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Make your interest work for you by paying off loans as soon as possible and by saving as much as possible. If possible, you want to choose an account that will have interest that compounds daily or monthly instead of yearly The more often your interest compounds, the more money you will make.
      </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      What is the Difference Between Compound and Continuous Interest?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Compound interest is applied every certain period of time (daily, monthly, yearly, etc.) while continous interest compounds using natural log and e. Continuous interest compound that the time between compounds is so small that it can be considered mathematically equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it this way: If you get 1% interest on $100 daily for a year after one day you will have $101, after two days you will have $102.01, notice that that is one cent more than if you had chosen to get your interest every two days, this doesn't seem like a lot of money but over time and with larger amounts this will really add up, day 3 you will have $103.0301. After a year you will have about $3778.34 which if you compunded yearly at 36.5% interest it seems like it would be the same but you only have $3750, but compounded daily you have about $28 more!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      How Do Loans Work?
    </h3>
    <p>
    Loans use interest too, but with loans, you are the one losing money. Always pay attention to the amount of interest you are paying on loans, it may not seem like a lot but if you are paying 24% interest yearly on a $1000 loan, you will have to pay back $1240. It's even worse if you interest compounds monthly. Say there's only a 2% interest rate monthly, that doesn't seem like a lot but after a year you will have paid about $1268.24. So always make sure to pay back your loans as soon as possible to avoid paying way more than you should.

    <h3>
      Being Smart With Your Interest
    </h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Use credit sparingly and if you have to buy things on credit pay it off AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! Credit card debt will not only hurt your credit score but if you do not pay off your debt before the deadline you may have to pay a fee that will add to your debt.</li>
          <li>The more often your interest compounds, the better, use time to your advantage.</li>
        <li>APY stands for ANNUAL PERCENTAGE YIELD. This will signify how much interest you will gain in a year. Choose a bank account with the highest APY in order to make your money stretch the farthest.</li>
        <li>Set aside money to put into your saings account. Before you spend your extra cash, take a portion of it and put it into your account. Be active in your savings, put money in every month or every year even if it’s just a few dollars, it will greatly contribute to your final amount.</li>
        <li>Reinvest the interest you make. Don’t spend the interest that you make everytime it compounds. Put it back into your account and allow that interest to aquire interest of its own.</li>
        <li>Save for retirement as early as possible. Time is your friend, the earlier you start the more money you will have for retirement and the earlier you can retire.</li>
        <li>Start saving for retirement by putting money into a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA will allow you to contribute money that you can take out tax-free when you are retirement age.
        The interest rates are normally between 7% and 10%. Say you set up your Roth when you are 20 and plan to retire at 60. You put in the maximum amount of money ($6000 yearly for people under 50 and $7000 for people over 50) for 40 years at 7% and by the end of that time you have $1,296,441.02.
        Over that time you put in $240,000 so you made $1,056,441.02 with the power of compound interest!</li>
