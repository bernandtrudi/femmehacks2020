  How Does Interest Work?
</h1>
<p>
  Interest can be your best friend or your worst enemy. 
  Make your interest work for you by paying off loans as soon as possible 
  and by saving as much as possible. 
  If possible, you want to choose an account that will have interest that compounds daily or monthly instead of yearly
  The more often your interest compounds, the more money you will make.
  Think of it this way: 
  If you get 10% interest on $100 daily for a year on day 1 you will have $, on day 2 you will have $10.201,
  notice that that is one tenth of a cent more than if you had chosen to get your interest every two days, this doesn't seem like a lot of money
  but over time and with larger amounts this will really add up,
  day 3 you will have $10.30301. After a year you will have about $377.83 which if you compunded yearly would only be $375
