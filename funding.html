      How Does Interest Work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Interest can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Make your interest
      work for you by paying off loans as soon as possible and by saving as much
      as possible. If possible, you want to choose an account that will have
      interest that compounds daily or monthly instead of yearly The more often
      your interest compounds, the more money you will make.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Difference between compound and continuous interest?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Compound interest is applied every certain period of time (daily, monthly,
      yearly, etc.) while continous interest compounds using natural log and e.
      Continuous interest compound that the time between compounds is so small
      that it can be considered mathematically equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it this way: If you get 1% interest on $100 daily for a year
      after one day you will have $101, after two days you will have $102.01,
      notice that that is one cent more than if you had chosen to get your
      interest every two days, this doesn't seem like a lot of money but over
      time and with larger amounts this will really add up, day 3 you will have
      $103.0301. After a year you will have about $3778.34 which if you
      compunded yearly at 36.5% interest it seems like it would be the same but
      you only have $3750, but compounded daily you have about $28 more!
    </p>
    <h2>
      How Do Loans Work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Loans work the same way but against you. Always pay attention to the
      amount of interest you are paying on loans, it may not seem like a lot but
      if you are paying 24% interest yearly on a $1000 loan, you will have to
      pay back $1240. It's even worse if you interest compounds monthly. Say
      there's only a 2% interest rate monthly, that doesn't seem like a lot but
      after a year you will have paid about $1268.24. So always make sure to pay
      back your loans as soon as possible to avoid paying way more than you
      should
